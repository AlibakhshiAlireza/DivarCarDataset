# Divar Website Data Crawling and Price Prediction Project

This project involves crawling the Divar website to obtain relevant data, preprocessing and mapping the data, and then flattening it to use for price prediction.

## Data Crawling from Divar Website

To gather data for analysis, we implemented a web crawler to scrape data from the Divar website. The crawled data includes various attributes related to products or items listed on the website.

## Data Preprocessing and Mapping

Once the data was obtained, we performed data preprocessing to handle missing values, outliers, and any data inconsistencies. Additionally, we mapped the data to ensure uniformity and ease of use in subsequent steps of the project.

## Data Flattening for Price Prediction

To predict prices accurately, we flattened the data and prepared it in a format suitable for input to the price prediction model. This involved organizing and transforming the data to be fed into the machine learning algorithm.

## Code

The code for this project is available in the respective folders for each stage of the process:

1. **Data Crawling:** The code used for crawling the Divar website is located in the `data_crawling` directory.

2. **Data Preprocessing and Mapping:** The preprocessing and mapping code can be found in the `data_preprocessing_mapping` directory.

3. **Data Flattening and Price Prediction:** The data flattening and price prediction model code are available in the `price_prediction` directory.

Feel free to explore the code to understand the implementation details and customize it according to your needs.
